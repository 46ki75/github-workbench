It's a bit inconvenient, but by specifying a template in the `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/` directory with query parameters, you can use different PR templates for different situations. However, you must specify the branch name, which adds to the inconvenience, and unfortunately, GitHub’s UI doesn’t provide a dropdown to select templates. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository).
